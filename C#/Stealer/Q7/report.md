Backstory:

I was running my tool to find new malware that is distributed in discord nitro scams on youtube and came across this interesting one, since it wasn't like any of the other ones which were mainly Redline which I catalog <a href="https://github.com/IlluminatiFish/RedlineCatalog">here.</a>


The description as usual with nitro scams gives us a link to download the supposed nitro generator from, so I decided to launch an <a href="https://app.any.run/">ANYRUN</a> task and analyse what is going on...


Download: https://mega.nz/file/s0sAWSRS#SPzCtzPrRip4bd1ZQzP5a8yyB_rKniLnroaQmUWc9_o

<b>VirusTotal: 25/70</b>

After downloading the zip file we open it to see a bunch of files as seen below

```
DiscordGeneratorByLupen
	- assets
	- generate.bin
	- Master-Release-DiscordGenerator.exe
	- NitroGeneator.dll
```

I then extracted & opened the executable, and suprisingly it threw an error, however it did try make a connection to the ip <b>185.182.82.35 on port 4420/tcp</b> about 3 times within the space of 2 minutes, which I found odd. Upon closer inspection it turns out it was exfiltrating (in JSON) the info it collected from the user's machine and sending it off to the bad actor, a sample of this exfiltrated data can be found <a href="https://github.com/IlluminatiFish/MalwareResearch/blob/main/C%23/Stealer/Q7/exfil_sample.json">here.</a>

After reading through the JSON that was exfiltrated it became apparent that this was an info stealer of some kind, so I then decided to run strings on the file and it came up with a few hundred intersting strings which gave me an indication to what it was exactly stealing so here is the full list of data stolen.
